# The big four

As you can see, there are four other plugins besides Otter that are part of the family. They are:
- Block Animation: allow you to add animation to any block.
- Blocks CSS: allow you to add custom CSS to any block.
- Block Export & Import: allow you to export and import blocks as JSON files.
- Otter Pro: a premium version of Otter that adds more blocks and features.

The first three are small plugins without a lot of code.
